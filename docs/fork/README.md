# niri fork docs

A fork of [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri), the scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor, run
under the [amane-shell](https://github.com/098765434/amane-shell) bar. It adds glass
effects, layout extras, a gesture and IPC for the shell; everything else is stock upstream.

Branch `ocbk`, based on the upstream release `v26.04`. Rebasing, branches and the full commit
log: [maintaining.md](maintaining.md).

| Secure fill | a password manager fills the focused field only if it's still the one it checked, and learns its owner from the socket | protocol `niri-secure-fill-v1` | [input/secure-fill.md](input/secure-fill.md); `resources/niri-secure-fill-v1.xml` | implemented, `85a7be33` |

Each feature doc starts with **Usage** (config, protocol or IPC), then **Design / internals**.

## Groups

- **Effects:** glass. [Materials](effects/materials.md) are the looks,
  [blur shapes](effects/blur-shapes.md) are how a client asks for them in its own shapes, and
  [vibrancy](effects/vibrancy.md) blends a client's labels with the glass under them.
  [Memory](effects/memory.md) is what all of it holds on the GPU and when it lets go.
- **Layout:** the scrolling layout's surroundings. The [workspace mat](layout/workspace-mat.md)
  fills the gaps, [gaps](layout/gaps.md) sets the space between workspaces and overview windows,
  and the [desktop layer](layout/desktop-layer.md) keeps widgets on the wallpaper.
- **Display:** [HDR](display/hdr.md), the output in HDR10 and clients' colour described through
  `wp-color-management-v1`.
- **Gestures:** [Mod swipe](gestures/mod-swipe.md), touchpad swipes on the focused window.
- **Input:** [Secure fill](input/secure-fill.md), checked password fill for the shell's input method.
- **IPC:** [events](ipc/events.md) a bar animates from, [actions](ipc/actions.md) a dock
  sends, and [features](ipc/features.md), how a client tells the fork from stock niri.

The protocol specs are authoritative for the wire format:
[`niri-blur-shapes-v1.xml`](../../resources/niri-blur-shapes-v1.xml) and
[`niri-vibrancy-v1.xml`](../../resources/niri-vibrancy-v1.xml).

## Used by

- **amane** (fork, which amane-shell is built with): the client side of blur shapes, vibrancy, the desktop layer and
  the IPC events and actions. See amane's
  [fork docs](https://github.com/098765434/amane/blob/ocbk/docs/fork/README.md).
- **amane-shell** (the bar, dock and widgets): see its
  [docs](https://github.com/098765434/amane-shell/blob/main/docs/README.md).

The workspace mat, gaps and mod swipe are used only by niri. HDR is set from amane-shell's
Shell Settings, over IPC and the config.

## Design history

Specs kept as written, with a status header:

- [design/gesture-ipc.md](design/gesture-ipc.md): the original spec for the gesture-progress
  IPC events.
